# Recipe Helper

- This is just a short little coding project I did which was inspired by me not knowing what to eat

- Aims: To help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridge. 
- The project is implemented using simple JavaScript and involves creating a web page where users can select ingredients from a list of checkboxes.
- There's only 10 Recipes because I wanted to do some experimenting first with the layout and codes

- There's another version that uses MongoDB but that's still a WIP :)
