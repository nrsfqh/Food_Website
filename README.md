#  Recipe Filtering Website (MongoDB Version)

- This is just a short little coding project I did which was inspired by me not knowing what to eat

- Aims: To help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridge.

- The application will allow users to select ingredients and cuisines they desire, and it filters to display the matching recipes. This version interacts with a MongoDB database using a Node.js application.

- The project is implemented using:
  - Simple JavaScripts
  - CSS
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB

- There's only 13 Recipes because I wanted to do some experimenting first with the layout and codes
