#  Recipe Filtering 

- This is just a short little coding project I did which was inspired by me not knowing what to eat

- Aims: To help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridge.

- The application will allows users to select ingredients and cuisines they desire, and it filters to display the matching recipes.

- The project is implemented using:
  - Simple JavaScript
  - CSS 

- There's only 10 Recipes because I wanted to do some experimenting first with the layout and codes

- There's another version that uses <a href="https://github.com/nrsfqh/Food_Website/tree/website_mongodb_Ver">MongoDB!</a>
